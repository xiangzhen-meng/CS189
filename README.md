# CS189 Self-Study Repository

This repository documents my self-study of [**UC Berkeley CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/).

It contains my completed homework, notes, ect. organized as a long-term learning archive.

The study plan and resource selection are largely inspired by [**csdiy.wiki**](https://csdiy.wiki/).

During the course of my self-study, I also referred to the following publicly available repositories for guidance and reference (no code was copied directly for submission purposes):
- [cy-Yin/UCBerkeley-CS189-Sp24-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/cy-Yin/UCBerkeley-CS189-Sp24-Machine-Learning)
- [2horse9sun/ucb_sp20_cs189_hw](https://github.com/2horse9sun/ucb_sp20_cs189_hw)

If you find this repository useful as a learning reference, feel free to explore it critically.
